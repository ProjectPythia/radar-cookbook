# Cookbook Template

This is a template for creating Project Pythia Cookbooks.

This repository includes all the basic infrastructure to create your content and host it online. You can use this template by selecting the green "Use this Template" button at the top of the page.

You can use the `notebook-template` in `/notebooks` as your content template!

Once you have made your new content, add it to the table of contents (`notebooks/_toc.yml`) file, and push it to Github!
