Then, the echo-top height is given by the height of the radar beam at an elevation angle:\\theta_T = (Z_T - Z_a) \\frac{\\theta_b - \\theta_a}{Z_b - Z_a} + \\theta_b\n\nwhere Z_T is the threshold value (e.g., 0 dBZ, 18 dBZ) used to compute the echo top.\n\nIf \\theta_{b} is the highest elevation scan available, set \\theta_{T} = \\theta_{b} + \\beta/2, where β is the half-power beamwidth. This condition is met far away from the radar if higher-elevation scans have shorter ranges than a base “surveillance” scan and very close to the radar if the highest-elevation scan does not sample the top of the cloud. Under these circumstances, \\theta_{T} is set to be the top of the beam containing dBZ \\geq Z_T; that is, the traditional echo-top algorithm is followed when there are no data available from a higher-elevation scan.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#overview","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#prerequisites","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Prerequisites"},"content":"Concepts\n\nImportance\n\nNotes\n\nMatplotlib Basics\n\nRequired\n\nBasic plotting\n\nIntro to Cartopy\n\nRequired\n\nGeospatial plotting\n\nPy-ART Basics\n\nRequired\n\nIO/Visualization\n\nNumba\n\nHelpful\n\nFamiliarity with vectorization/optimization of Python functions\n\nTime to learn: 25 minutes\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#prerequisites","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Imports"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#imports","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Imports"},"content":"\n\nimport pyart\nimport numpy as np\nfrom echotop import cloud_top_height, grid_cloud_top\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#imports","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Define our function to compute ETH on a uniform x-y grid"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/notebooks/example-workflows/echo-top-height#define-our-function-to-compute-eth-on-a-uniform-x-y-grid","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Echo top height calculation from NEXRAD PPI volume data:","lvl2":"Define our function to compute ETH on a uniform x-y grid"},"content":"The input file can be a Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) archive file from Amazon Web Services.

Therefore, for example, a phase shift of 3\\pi would erroneously be detected as a phase shift of -\\pi and give an incorrect value of velocity when retrieved by the radar. This phenomena is called aliasing. The maximium unambious velocity that can be detected by the radar before aliasing occurs is called the Nyquist velocity.\n\nIn the next example, you will see an example of aliasing occurring, where the values of +15 m/s abruptly transition into a region of -15 m/s, with -5 m/s in the middle of the region around 37 N, 97 W.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/foundations/pyart-corrections#an-overview-of-aliasing","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Py-ART Corrections","lvl3":"Calculate Velocity Texture","lvl2":"Dealiasing our Velocity"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/notebooks/foundations/pyart-corrections#calculate-velocity-texture","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Py-ART Corrections","lvl3":"Calculate Velocity Texture","lvl2":"Dealiasing our Velocity"},"content":"First, for dealiasing to work efficiently, we need to use a GateFilter.

So, how do weather radars work? Let’s start with the basics. Radar stands for RAdio Detection and Ranging, and it is an electronic instrument used for the detection and ranging of distant objects that scatter or reflect radio energy emmitted by the radar. A Doppler radar is a radar that detects and interprets the Doppler Effect in terms of the radial velocity (speed towards or away from the radar) of a target.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/radar-basics/radar-basics#doppler-radar","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"The Basics of Weather Radar","lvl3":"Emmitted Energy","lvl2":"How do
